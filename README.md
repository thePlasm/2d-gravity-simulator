A 2D HTML5 Canvas Gravity Simulator by Rasmus 'thePlasm' Jepsen

## Mechanics & Controls
Click and/or drag to make an entity that is affected by gravity and elastic collisions. The mass input area lets you edit its mass, the radius input, the radius of it and the restitution one is for the restitution of the walls. Each pixel is 1 metre. Right-clicking on an entity removes it.
